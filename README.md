Engineering for Kids Day (E4K) is an annual outreach event hosted by the UC Berkeley engineering community. E4K hosts hundreds of students in grades 4-6 for a FREE one-day science and engineering education event on the UC Berkeley campus. Kids participate in fun, hands-on engineering activities organized and taught by UC Berkeley undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. E4K also encourages the participation of underrepresented students in the local community by contacting local outreach programs, Title I schools, and making arrangements to guarantee those students a spot in the program.
