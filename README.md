# Engineering For Kids Website 
## About Engineering for Kids
Engineering for Kids Day (E4K) is an annual outreach event hosted by the UC Berkeley engineering 
community. E4K hosts hundreds of students in grades 4-6 for a FREE one-day science and engineering 
education event on the UC Berkeley campus. Kids participate in fun, hands-on engineering activities 
organized and taught by UC Berkeley undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. E4K also encourages the 
participation of underrepresented students in the local community by contacting local outreach programs, 
Title I schools, and making arrangements to guarantee those students a spot in the program.


## Things to Know
Pages hosted at
[e4k.berkeley.edu](https://e4k.berkeley.edu)

All pages before Fall 2017 were lost, but can be viewed using the 
[wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130415000000*/e4k.berkeley.edu). 
There isn't much on these pages (other than badly styled wordpress), but something may prove useful.

### How to work on this repo
1. Make sure you are added to the Web team. This should give you admin access to this repository. Ask the 
web-dev lead to add you if you don't have access.  
2. Make sure your version of master is up to date.
3. Create a new branch to dev on. Don't directly modify master
4. Create a Pull Request into master. Either approve it yourself or ask someone else to review it if your
changes are important. In the PR, make sure you state which files you will upload to our server. 
5. Ensure you have access to our web hosting account. An easy way is to download 
[cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/). Then connect with SFTP to upload the files. If you do not know the 
credentials for ssh, ask the web-dev lead. DO NOT enter credentials into this repo since it is public.

The structure of this repository should make it easy for concurrent development and easy transferring of 
responsibilities from year to year. Our rules ensure live pages are reflected in the master branch, so 
pull requests should ensure changes are consistent with the "working copy". 

###  Repository structure
#### Archive
Past pages we have used. Probably won't ever need again. If decided on to get rid of, we should make sure
to save the past graphics (put it on Drive).
####  Current Structure
Pages were taken from a free design "enno". The layout of our pages and images/styling needs isn't great. 
But if we change the layout of our site we can scrap this and have a more meaningful structure. 


## To Do
1. Figure out the ssh password
2. Web design changes....
